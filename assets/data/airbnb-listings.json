Direkt an der Warschauer Brücke befindet sich die Mercedes-Benz-Arena und gleich davor die berühmte East Side Gallery am Ufer der Spree.  Der Alexanderplatz mit dem Fernsehturm ist von hier zu sehen und in circa 30 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen, entlang der schönen Karl-Marx-Allee.",

Since we did not have one problem during our stay I cannot comment on how Li might have responded if we'd called on her but she was very quick and pleasant with our last minute queries about leaving the apartment safe and secure on our final day.

    "summary": "Located in the best part of Kreuzberg with a lot of calme and its nice restaurants and bars is my flatshare! Since I´m a travel girl my room is often vacated - your opportunity to dive into the real Berlin!",
    "space": "It´s a beautiful room in an old building with old wooden floors and high ceilings. The room is big, spacious with a cozy double bed, a sofa and a small 60's desktop, where you can work or write postcards. With me, there´s one other people living in the apartment, 2 germans and one french girl; everyone is over 28 and everyone is a real berliner based person; they are amazing, and also, they are not so often home. So you will feel supported but not annoyed at all. Since we´re a flatshare the bathroom might not be perfectly clean at times (not often, though), which we hope you won´t mind. We make sure to keep it totally tolerable for everyone, and if there´s ever any concern for you just let us know because we want you to feel at home here and as satisfied with your stay as possible!",

    "experiences_offered": "none",
    "neighborhood_overview": "This is the best part of Kreuzberg! Just around the canal , four minutes walking you will be on the heart of the beautiful green berlin. And at the other side of the street you have Marheineke Markthalle, and the Bergmanstrasse (far away enought to do not feel disturb about it continous life, but in a walking distance of four minutes); its the centre of this Kreuzberg area, there you can have a lot of different awesome food, as well shopping, in a lovely mood and with open spaces.  I love the atmosphere, international and alive, with a lot of kids playing on the park, and lot of  restaurants and cafés. You definitely have to checkt out the \"Chapter One\", an amazing professional barista coffee shop where they do one of the most amazing coffee of Berlin. Also close to the house are two of the more fancy and awesome green points in Berlin: the Hasenheide park, and the old airport Tempelhof (is a must to walk around there if you are visiting Berlin!)",
    "notes": "We´re usually busy doing our work routines so you are pretty much independent and it feels like you are alone in the flat most of the times.",
    "transit": "The flat is located extremely well, walking distance to a lot of interesting places for visit, and two minutes walking to the Gneisenaustrasse underground station, which drives you in 10 minutes in u-bahn to Mitte (the city center).",
    "access": "The U-Bahn station Gneisenaustrasse is only two minutes walk away, with this line U7 you can get directly to the airport Schonefeld, and also super well connected for Tegel. I will make a wellcome kit-map and explain you all this information. Also, there are plenty of supermarkets and shops where the room is located.",
    "interaction": "I will be in the city often, and in the opposite case, I will be always available for answering all your questions, so dont hesitate to contact me any time (almost 24 hours by phone and email) in case you got any questions or problems or you need something. If you want, the bed sleeps 2 people easily, so it´s suitable for friends/couples as well. If needed, an extra 120cm mattress can be put in. Usage of kitchen no problem, towels and linen are all there and included. You are welcome to help yourself to anything! Also, there´s a washing machine that you may use",

I am vegetarian, I make daily yoga and sport.  But i also love goings to bars and dancing. \r\n\r\nI couldnt live without music, drawing, books, cameras , sun, sea, friends, art , water & bananas. \r\n\r\nI love to travel for meeting myself in a different circumstances and making an exchange with the world and the people who one meet on the way. For learning. I am quite addicted to this exchange of new people and experiences.  I travel on my own city often, trying to watch it as if I was a tourist, as the first time again.  \r\nI never had bad experiences traveling, and I believe is cause of the energy one projects . World is energy on movement and I enjoy going within it.\r\nMy best journey was walking alone \"El camino de santiago\"in Spain. India and Israel were also amazing-life-changing trips.  \r\nI was \"couchsourfer\" for a long time when I was younger and I host over 100 people for free in Spain and Germany, that gave me a lot of life-teaching, a lot of respect , and unfortunately also a bit of suspicion.",

Zum Preis allgemein. Ich denke 35 - 40 Euro ist auch für ein Zimmer mit Küchen- und Badnutzung angemessen, da die Lage mit ihrer Umgebung (Rosenthaler Platz, Mauerpark, Weinbergspark, Eberswalderstraße, Alexanderplatz, Hackescher Markt, Museumsinsel - das meiste in 5 bis 15 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen) einzigartig ist.

Hallo Ich bin der Daniel :)\r\n\r\n-since this is a rather international community I'll write in English, but I speak fluent German, English and Hungarian. \r\n\r\nI am an Actor/Singer/Dancer living in Berlin. I am happy to share my own place through the cumminuty, together with my friend Dalma. We are looking forward to welcome you and provide you with a great and comfortable stay in West-Berlin, in one of the nicest residential areas of the city in the 'Bayerischen-Viertel' (Bayern-Distric). This area is rich in parks and in pre-war architecture, and shows a more traditional look of the Berlin as it was before the second world war. Yet it is all very close to the modern city life of Kurfürstendamm, Zoo, Tiergarten, Nollendorfplatz, Potsdamer Platz and to all the vibrant metropolis features that the city has become to offer.  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nAbout me:\r\n I don't have pets and I do not smoke. I prefer quiet evenings with a good movie, self made healthy food, listening to the the daily news, and some educative documentaries with a glass of good wine. I usually travel with my own car, and I travel a lot between  the Budapest and Düsseldorf, Hamburg and Vienna axis. I prefer hand-luggage over hiking-gear and positively thinking people with ideas of the world to talk about as company. Looking forward to meet you in person.",

If I am not here, there is a wide array of Berlin and German tour guides, both underground and main stream that are available in the apartment.  \r\n\r\nBecause I travel a lot of the time, most likely my neighbor and friend Susanna will take care of letting you into the apartment and the key exchange. You will be renting the entire apartment (2 bedrooms, 1 living room, kitchen and full bath). If I am in Berlin during your stay, I will most likely be upstairs in another apartment and will be around for any questions you may have. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like more information please feel free to message me anytime, and I will respond ASAP. :)",

For learning. I am quite addicted to this exchange of new people and experiences.  I travel on my own city often, trying to watch it as if I was a tourist, as the first time again.  \r\nI never had bad experiences traveling, and I believe is cause of the energy one projects . World is energy on movement and I enjoy going within it.\r\nMy best journey was walking alone \"El camino de santiago\"in Spain. India and Israel were also amazing-life-changing trips.  \r\nI was \"couchsourfer\" for a long time when I was younger and I host over 100 people for free in Spain and Germany, that gave me a lot of life-teaching, a lot of respect , and unfortunately also a bit of suspicion.",

    "description": "A proper 1,5m bed, a sofa (if you dont need a second bed) or a second bed, shelves, whole body mirror, table and a nice view over a playground, a park and Friedrichshain. Quiet and safe neighborhood, but still very close to everything.  Very well communicated with sbahn and trams. Our flat consists of a living room, a big room,  a smaller bedroom,  a bathroom with a bath tub and a kitchen with a washing machine and a dishwasher. It is situated in Friedrichshain, one of the coolest areas in Berlin.  Very central, spacious, sunny and good communicated with Sbahn, tram and bus. Amazing view over Friedrichshain, a park and a playground, top floor and very quiet. High ceilings, recently renovated, super new and clean. We are renting the smaller room for a maximum period of two weeks. When we are away we rent also the bigger room. The area is quiet but still very close to Simon Dach Strasse, one of the busiest streets in Berlin with loads of cafes, restaurants, shops etc.  Just a few meters",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Our neighbourhood is lovely. Very quiet and safe with young people mainly in their late 20s or 30s German and international living near. It is situated near the beautiful park Volkspark and has another small park even nearer. There are loads of late night shops just round the corner, three supermarkets, three very good Italian restaurants, a Vietnamese restaurant, an Asian & sushi take away, an Indian, a German, a cheap burger place and a cheap pizza place very close! Vivantes hospital is a tram stop away.",

    "transit": "You can get to our place with the Sbahn or tram! The tram runs 24/7. There is an sbahn that takes you to ours directly from Schönefeld airport and from Tegel it is an Sbahn and a bus. Super easy and fast! I will send you exact details how to get to ours with screenshots and all info you need to make your arrival easier for you.",
    "access": "Access to the kitchen, fridge, bathroom utilities, washing machine, hair dryer. We upgraded the guest room, so now you will have a 1,5 proper bed to your disposal along with a sofa or another bed if you need it, a table, a whole body mirror, shelves, towels. Very sunny room, equipped with curtains. Please inform us if you need two beds or one before your arrival.",
    "interaction": "If the guests and ourselves have time, it is always a pleasure to spend some time with them and get to know them, go out with them or just hang out at home. We both work full time though and have a busy schedule so it all depends. Of course we don't mind at all if the guests don't feel like interacting. We are totally fine with that too!",
    "house_rules": "_ Please NO DOWNLOADING! In Germany it is illegal to download films, series, music etc and you could end up in court & will have to pay a big fine for that. Turn off your torrents or any other download sites, BEFORE you log in in our wifi. You can find the wifi password on a paper. Please fill in with your personal data. _You are not allowed to have guests, unless we are aware and ok with it. _This is a no shoes apartment. Please take your slippers with you, ask us to lend a pair or walk with no shoes inside. We have expensive rugs, that we cannot afford to have cleaned every time a guest leaves. My parents had a no shoes policy in their house and I always despised them for that and felt bad when they asked my friends to take off their shoes. But guess what? I now do the same. :) On top I have a dust allergy and need a dustless environment. _You need to lock the door if you leave the flat if noone is at home and shut down the windows. You shouldn't use the latch (lock on the door), bec",

I speak English, German, Italian, Spanish and Greek.\r\n\r\nI live in Friedrichshain, Berlin with my husband Max, who is working as a product manager at two music labels. We are in our thirties and work every day during the week and travel or dj and party on the weekend. We dj and produce electronic music (slow techno, acid, post disco, chug), have a blog and run our own events. \r\n\r\nWe love traveling, music, films, art, parties and meeting new interesting people. \r\n\r\nWe enjoy having friends over at ours and are smokers.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ ★★★★★\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to Berlin! We would love to help you have a great time here, give you tips (sightseeing or partying) and if there is time and will from both sides, hang out with you!\r\n\r\nFind the room with the title:\r\nCute sunny room in Friedrichshain\r\n\r\nRarely we can offer you the room with the title:\r\nSunny Room with a great view in FH!\r\n\r\nWe are always happy to meet new people from all over the world! \r\n\r\nBut after doing airbnb for four years now and having made different experiences, we are a bit picky.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nWe prefer to host adults between 22-45 years old, you need to have a picture and write in your request what you do for a living and what is the purpose of your travel. We will be staying a few nights under the same roof, so it would be good if we more or less got along.\r\n\r\n We would also prefer to have guests who will not be cooking at home (had the forgotten hot plate/stove or burnt pans and smell all over the house way too many times so far. It's not really worth the risk, since our own flat/things are at stake, so we prefer to be careful than sorry). You can of course keep things in the fridge, just no cooking please. Eating out in Berlin is very cheap anyways and we are happy to give you tips.\r\n\r\nWe also have the rule of no shoes in the house, you would have to leave them in the flat by the entrance. \r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to bring people back to the flat. No extra guests please!\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and don't hesitate to ask us any questions.",

You would have access to everything the apartment has to offer (kitchen, living room, bathrooms, internet, towels, bedsheets etc). I absolutely love this apartment not only for its perfect location but for the light and the quiet that it offers.  It has been decorated with love, care and a certain \"french touch\" since I am originally from Paris. The one thing to know is that the apartment is organized a little strangely and although there is a restroom and a sink reserved for the guests in the entrance, you have to cross my bedroom to access the bathroom. It has never been a problem with any guests and during the day until late at night this bedroom serves as a passage room since I spend very little time in there anyways.",

Because of two opposite balconies in the living and kitchen area and the gallery to the bedroom area, the light-filled apartment invites to sit and relax in the bustle of the capital. We are reachable via email or phone at any time. We also have a café on the ground floor, where we are daily from 8 to 18 o’clock. The cafe and the apartment are in the same house directly close to Rosenthaler Platz, where many restaurants and bars are. In walking distance there is a small park and a playground. Alexanderplatz can be reached in a few minutes. For a good start in the morn",

I am vegetarian, I make daily yoga and sport.  But i also love goings to bars and dancing. \r\n\r\nI couldnt live without music, drawing, books, cameras , sun, sea, friends, art , water & bananas. \r\n\r\nI love to travel for meeting myself in a different circumstances and making an exchange with the world and the people who one meet on the way. For learning. I am quite addicted to this exchange of new people and experiences.  I travel on my own city often, trying to watch it as if I was a tourist, as the first time again.  \r\nI never had bad experiences traveling, and I believe is cause of the energy one projects . World is energy on movement and I enjoy going within it.\r\nMy best journey was walking alone \"El camino de santiago\"in Spain. India and Israel were also amazing-life-changing trips.  \r\nI was \"couchsourfer\" for a long time when I was younger and I host over 100 people for free in Spain and Germany, that gave me a lot of life-teaching, a lot of respect , and unfortunately also a bit of suspicion.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Victoria-Kiez, where I live is a pre-cool area of Berlin, where gentrification has  just started. I like the mixture of little-village-feeling and metropolitan life.  Down my street is a very good bagel and espresso bar, few restaurants, the best icecream in town :-) and a supermarket, which is open until 10 p.m. even on saturdays - which is not so common in germany. There a two stores selling organic food (and vegan groceries) within 5-10 minutes walk. For the visual hunger there are two art galleries down the streets and in the neighbours building. If you like nightlife you are within 10 bicycle minutes of \"about blank\", \"Wilde Renate\" and \"sysiphos\", three places to be if you are into Berlin electronic music scene. Berghain is 20 bicycle minutes away.",

The S-Bahn-Stop Nöldnerplatz connects you directly and frequently with the whole city until 1 a.m at night. Weekends all night long.  Trains run every 5 minutes and during weekends all night long (during night about every 15-30 Minutes).  There is no parking fee in my neighbourhood (yet) and depending on your arrival time it is easy to find a parking lot. In the evenings it is harder than during day.  If you arrive by plane, it takes 45 minutes to my place (both Tegel and Schönefeld), by  train 20 minutes from the Central Station Hauptbahnhof.",

There is a functional bike waiting for you and a rental-shop down the street, if you come as a couple, and need another one. We share the modern bathroom, towels will be provided as well as shampoo or showergel in case you need some.  The kitchen and fridge are at your disposal, too.  You can use spices and basic kitchen stuff like oil or butter. On your first day you can make yourself espresso or porridge before you go on your first grocery shopping tour.  During summer it is nice to sit in the backyard of the house or relax in the hammock in the garden.",

So far 80 guests have stayed at my place and brought a lot of interesting thoughts, impressions, recipes and shared experiences into my life! I am looking forward to every new guest.   I love nature and I try not to spoil water and energy but that does not mean that I never do long showers or a bath once in a while.

I speak English, German, Italian, Spanish and Greek.\r\n\r\nI live in Friedrichshain, Berlin with my husband Max, who is working as a product manager at two music labels. We are in our thirties and work every day during the week and travel or dj and party on the weekend. We dj and produce electronic music (slow techno, acid, post disco, chug), have a blog and run our own events. \r\n\r\nWe love traveling, music, films, art, parties and meeting new interesting people. \r\n\r\nWe enjoy having friends over at ours and are smokers.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ ★★★★★\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to Berlin! We would love to help you have a great time here, give you tips (sightseeing or partying) and if there is time and will from both sides, hang out with you!\r\n\r\nFind the room with the title:\r\nCute sunny room in Friedrichshain\r\n\r\nRarely we can offer you the room with the title:\r\nSunny Room with a great view in FH!\r\n\r\nWe are always happy to meet new people from all over the world! \r\n\r\nBut after doing airbnb for four years now and having made different experiences, we are a bit picky.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nWe prefer to host adults between 22-45 years old, you need to have a picture and write in your request what you do for a living and what is the purpose of your travel. We will be staying a few nights under the same roof, so it would be good if we more or less got along.\r\n\r\n We would also prefer to have guests who will not be cooking at home (had the forgotten hot plate/stove or burnt pans and smell all over the house way too many times so far. It's not really worth the risk, since our own flat/things are at stake, so we prefer to be careful than sorry). You can of course keep things in the fridge, just no cooking please. Eating out in Berlin is very cheap anyways and we are happy to give you tips.\r\n\r\nWe also have the rule of no shoes in the house, you would have to leave them in the flat by the entrance. \r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to bring people back to the flat. No extra guests please!\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and don't hesitate to ask us any questions.",
